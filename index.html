		<div class = "box1"><p>"happy years;" Is meant to be a heartfelt story, of not only the love the three women will share for each other later, but each 
		individual will represent a core value of mental health and emotional health. Its important in our society that we pass on knowledgable values, 
		even through fiction like stories. "Happy years;" with myself and my co-creator, Odette, thought that being able to pass important messages on 
		important subjects, such as; LGBTQ community, racism, prejudices, abuse, etc, will be able to suggest to start a productive conversation. The material may trigger 
		you, so we gently advise that before reading the one season series "happy years;" that you may seek advice from a close friend, close parent, or anyone you 
		closely trust. We will always offer support through fan community, because anything helps, and we fully understand the sensitivity of each subject.
		The series for happy years will be out december of 2019! stay tuned and follow me on instgarm for updates! @m.j.illuatrates, or just click the button below!</p></div>
