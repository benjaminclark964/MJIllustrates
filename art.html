		<div class = "box1"><p> The products I use for my digital art are "Procreate", including my Ipad Air 1, with my Wacom Bamboo pen. I believe as a artist, yes 
		buying more high qualtiy items for art work helps just a little bit, but for the most part it relies on the quality of your technique and skill set in art. 
		I started off with Traditional Art, which included painting with acrylic, gouche, and other mediums. As a fellow artist, or just a friend, you may know 
		that I have a billion sketch books as well. None of them are finished to the last page.(haha) Please enjoy my selection of art I collaborated over the 
		years, from traditonal to digital!</p></div>
