		<p> Hey, call me MJ. I am an artist based in Boise, Idaho. I am a partime illustrator and a traditonal artist. I began my art journey at a very young age. 
		I went to a traditional art private school for for firt two years of my high school career, but for the most part, I am self-taught. I began to create 
		"happy years;" as a reflection of my own story, and the story of others who were willing to share through teh beautiful characters developed on each page. "
		happy years;" is a heart felt, warming series, including the subjects of mental health, social health and justice. With a little bit of action of course, b
		ecause who doesnt love action packed scenes. My art is my own personal taste of simple, gentle aesthics to the vibrance that the world has had to offer to me. 
		I hope you enjoy my art, and you can find solstice and the same gentleness that I create with each stroke of my pens or brushes. </p>
